# Hidden-Markov-Model---Blood-Glucose-States

Created while a junior at Vassar College majoring in Cognitive science. 
This project was my final for the class COGS 319: Modeling Minds, Brains, and Behavior, professor Dr. Josh de Leeuw.
In this project, I recreate a portion of current diabetes CGM technology, trend prediction in R.
